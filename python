Python Notes:
---------------------------------------------
When assigning 2 variables to one another, they will use the same memory allocation.

print("Hello World") #This will print "Hello World".
print keyword to print to console/terminal.
"#" is used to make inline comments
"=" Assignment Operator
vairables cannot start with a number
"+" for string can be used to concatenate them
you cannot add string and numbers using "+"
data structures allows us to store a list of values in a single variable.
List = data structure, allows us to store multiple variable types, inc a list inside a list.
"List.length" can be used to determine the length of a list.
Tuples, Sets are similiar to lists, Tuples cannot be modified and sets contains unique elements and is declared using curly braces and accessed using keys.
Operators are instuctions that perform operations on variables and values in python.
arithmetic operator is most common and used for mathematical calculations.
"*" is used to multiply 
exponent operator used to raise a number to a power.
"/" is used to divide.
"%" is used to divide and return the remainder, it is called modulus.
"*" in context of a string var can multiply the string to repeat multiple times.
Logical operators = AND, OR, NOT.
AND = both values are true, 
OR = atleast one values is true,
NOT = will flip the boolean value, so if it's true, NOT will makes it false
